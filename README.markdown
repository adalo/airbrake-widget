HopToad Widget
==============

This is a Mac OS X widget for the [HopToad](http://hoptoadapp.com) app. Just inform your subdomain and API key and you're ready to go!

I started this widget on Dashcode, so the code is little messy! Should have made it using TextMate only! :P

Installing
----------

Just clone this repo and double click the widget icon.
